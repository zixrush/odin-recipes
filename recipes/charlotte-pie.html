        <h2>Description</h2>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Apple Charlotte is a British dessert that is made with apples and white bread and baked in a molded pan. My version uses an easy cake batter and tastes just as delicious, if not better. And you don't need the molded pan! Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or at room temperature with a sprinkle of powdered sugar.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>3 pounds Honeycrisp apples, peeled, cored, and chopped</li>
            <li>½ cup apple butter</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped crystallized ginger</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons apple brandy, preferably Calvados</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, divided</li>
            <li>12 slices white bread</li>
        </ul>
       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
       <li>Melt 4 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in chopped apples, apple butter, crystallized ginger, brandy, lemon zest and juice, salt, ground ginger, and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Cover and cook over medium-low heat until apples have softened, 15 to 20 minutes. Uncover and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has evaporated and mixture has thickened, an additional 10 to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool while you prepare the crust.</li> 
       
       <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
       
       <li>Melt remaining 12 tablespoons butter in a small microwave-safe bowl, in 15- to 30-second intervals. Stir in remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon.</li>
       
       <li>Remove crusts from bread slices. Gently dip both sides of each bread slice in melted cinnamon butter and arrange inside a 9x5-inch loaf pan, cutting them as needed to line the bottom and sides of the pan completely. Overlap pieces slightly to ensure there are no cracks. Spoon in the apple mixture and cover with remaining butter-dipped bread slices.</li>
       
       <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bread is crisp and golden, about 50 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand at room temperature for 10 minutes. Place a plate or serving platter over the loaf pan and flip so the bottom has now become the top.</li>
       </ol>
